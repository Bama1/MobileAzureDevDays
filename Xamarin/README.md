# Xamarin.iOS Build

To start building a Xamarin iOS app, first of all, you need to connect to your repository service (GitHub, Bitbucket, VSTS) account,
select a repository and a branch where your app lives and then you can set up your first build. Choose the solution file and 
the configuration that you would like to build; for the app to run on a real device, the build needs to be code signed 
with a valid provisioning profile and a certificate.
